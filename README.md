===============

Pop up a splash screen graphic during your heavy setup function

**NOTE : This hasn't worked for a while. Happy to take any pull requests which can make it up to date.**


Notes
-----

* Uses glfw (Windows + OSX supported)
* Tested on OSX
* Currently you need to rename your `setup` function to `setup2` and run it on the second frame
